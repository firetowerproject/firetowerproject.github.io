      <description>Gentlemen,
United by our common bonds, we write to discuss an opportunity created to provide a great journey. Long ago for some, a recent time for many, we all ran under the banner of black and gold towards one common goal: to achieve the highest glory possible as a cross country team borne out of these treasured and endless mountains trails. There were the close attempts of 7th place in 2001, and 10th in 2000, 2003, and 2007 at Regionals, but not since 1994 has Appalachian cross country reached the pinnacle of NCAA championships.</description>

      <description>As members of the team, we all looked to help take the team to a higher level from when we started. The Firetower Project presents us with the opportunity to help perpetuate the program&amp;rsquo;s success after we have graduated.</description>

      <description>Our vision statement is a reflection on the impacts of the Firetower Project when it is achieving its mission.
 It&amp;rsquo;s the Fall of 2025. Excitement has been growing around the AppState men&amp;rsquo;s cross country program. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since the team is headed into the regional meet with a chance at making the NCAA championship.
The team has spent most of the season in the &amp;ldquo;others receiving votes&amp;rdquo; category in the national rankings, and they are pumped and ready to go at the regional meet after winning yet another conference championship two weeks ago, which almost felt like a formality.</description>
